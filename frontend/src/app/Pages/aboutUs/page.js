                  Ayurveda, meaning "The Science of Life," is an ancient Indian
                  system of healing that dates back over 5,000 years. It takes a
                  holistic approach to health, aiming to balance the body, mind,
                  and spirit through natural remedies, lifestyle changes, and
                  dietary practices.

                  Mental Health refers to emotional, psychological, and social
                  well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and behave in daily
                  life, influencing how we cope with stress, relate to others,
                  and make decisions. Nurturing mental health is essential for
                  leading a fulfilling and balanced life.
